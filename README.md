# GlobalPlanner
The implementation of a global planner using A* algorithm as a plugin for ROS-Navigation stack.


This repo is part of a project for motion planning for autonmous vehicles in dynamic environments. The project uses Hierarchical approach in order to make the best planner considering the designer criteria.
A hierarchical approach combines different motion planning techniques in two stages: Global Planning, and Local Planning. 

This repository is part of the project for implementing global planner using A* algorithm and Gradient Descent method. 


Further descriptions will be added soon...
